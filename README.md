dotfiles
========
Bootstrap a home directory. Clone into ~/code/dotfiles and run setup.sh.
May not work if it gets cloned somewhere else (probably a good TODO there).

external setup
==============
Relatively minimal at this point, but make sure to grab:

* https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts/tree/master/SourceCodePro

post-setup
==========
* pop into vim and run :VundleInstall
* configure ssh keys/authorized keys & keychain
